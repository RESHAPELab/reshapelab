Through our study with Mozilla‚Äôs PDF.js, the agent has proven to help reduce the reliance on human mentors by providing timely and relevant information, streamlining the development process. </p> <p> üë• Authors: </p> <ul><li>Jo√£o Correia, Daniel Coutinho, Caio Barbosa & Alessandro Garcia, PUC-Rio </li><li>Morgan C. Nicholson, University of S√£o Paulo (USP) </li> <li>Marco Castelluccio, Mozilla Corporation </li> <li>Marco Gerosa & Igor Steinmacher, Northern Arizona University </li> </ul> <p> This paper not only pushes the boundaries of AI in software engineering but also offers practical tools to improve productivity and efficiency in development workflows. </p> <p> We look forward to sharing more insights at the upcoming AIware 2024 conference in Porto de Galinhas </p> ",

The proposal, titled 'Enhancing the Quality of Software Projects: Techniques for Supporting Software Development with a Focus on Process and Product Quality,' aims to develop new technologies to improve software quality. It focuses on enhancing user experience (UX) and developer experience (DX) through innovative approaches. The project will apply evidence-based methodologies for creating new approaches, focusing on conceiving inclusive technologies with a special interest in diverse populations.</p> <p>This grant was awarded by the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) as part of a solicitation that focused on fostering the internationalization of Brazilian universities by strengthening their collaboration with strong groups outside of Brazil.></p><p>This project is led by Dr. Tayana Uch√¥a Conte, Associate Professor at the Federal University of Amazonas, in collaboration with Dr. Igor Steinmacher, Assistant Professor at SICCS. According to the plan, NAU will receive 6 scholars in an 18-month time frame, including 2 Ph.D. candidates, 2 Early Career Researchers, and 2 Senior Researchers. </p>",
