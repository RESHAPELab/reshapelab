But for beginners, jumping into OSS can feel like being handed the keys to a spaceship without a manual. That’s where RESHAPE Lab comes in! </p> <p> At the Engineering Fest, our team—Karissa Smallwood, Connor Aiton, Pedro Arantes, Italo Santos, and Jadyn Calhoun—showcased our project on gamifying GitHub. </p> <p> The goal? To make open-source onboarding more engaging and beginner-friendly for computer science students. We’ve reimagined the learning process by gamifying the GitHub, where students level up by contributing to real-world projects—unlocking skills, confidence, and maybe even a bit of fun along the way. </p> <p> Curious how it works? Or want to share your own thoughts on making OSS more accessible? Let’s chat! 💬 </p>",

This milestone underscores RESHAPE Lab's commitment to the forefront of software engineering and artificial intelligence research. </p> <p> The paper introduces a novel conversational agent that enhances how developers interact with software projects. Utilizing a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, the agent reduces reliance on human mentors by providing direct access to project-specific data, thereby streamlining the development process. This tool represents a significant step toward automating developer support, making it both more efficient and accessible. </p> <p> Our findings from a detailed case study on Mozilla’s PDF.js project demonstrate the agent's ability to outperform traditional human-based support in many scenarios, highlighting its potential to transform developer interactions in open-source software projects. This research not only contributes to academic knowledge but also offers practical tools for improving productivity and efficiency in software development. </p> <p> This study was also supported by the National Science Foundation (award #2303042) titled 'Learning Software Engineering by Contributing to Real Projects With Chatbot Assistance'. This research explores the impactful role of conversational agents in enhancing support in open source communities. </p> <p> We look forward to sharing our insights at AIware 2024  in Porto de Galinhas and continuing to advance the field of AI in software engineering. </p> <img src='../images/posts/20240101_AIWARE.jpg'>",
