My research focuses on analyzing social aspects in developers' discussions on pull requests and their impact on design decay. Additionally, I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at PUC-Rio, with a research focus on investigating the relation between social aspects and software quality.  Finally, I am a member of the OPUS research group at PUC-Rio's Software Engineering Laboratory. With over 9 years of industry experience, I have developed a strong expertise in software development, which  encompass back-end development using Python and Java, full-stack development for Android, and proficiency in working with SQL and non-SQL databases like Firebase, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. Throughout my career, I have engaged in diverse projects, encompassing the following areas: (i) I have contributed to the development of automatic refactoring tools, enhancing the efficiency and maintainability of software systems. (ii) I have designed and implemented various Android applications, leveraging my expertise in mobile development. (iii) I have built data analytic systems using Python, enabling data-driven insights and decision-making. (iv) I have utilized Spring Boot to develop robust back-end solutions, ensuring seamless integration and efficient functionality. ",
