My research focuses on analyzing social aspects in developers' discussions on pull requests and their impact on design decay. Additionally, I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at PUC-Rio, with a research focus on investigating the relation between social aspects and software quality.  Finally, I am a member of the OPUS research group at PUC-Rio's Software Engineering Laboratory. With over 9 years of industry experience, I have developed a strong expertise in software development, which  encompass back-end development using Python and Java, full-stack development for Android, and proficiency in working with SQL and non-SQL databases like Firebase, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. Throughout my career, I have engaged in diverse projects, encompassing the following areas: (i) I have contributed to the development of automatic refactoring tools, enhancing the efficiency and maintainability of software systems. (ii) I have designed and implemented various Android applications, leveraging my expertise in mobile development. (iii) I have built data analytic systems using Python, enabling data-driven insights and decision-making. (iv) I have utilized Spring Boot to develop robust back-end solutions, ensuring seamless integration and efficient functionality. ",

I've done a few research projects and personal projects so far, but I'm always looking for more. So far, my main topics of focus have been Website Design, Game Design, and Research into AI, and how we can best use it. I have a love for learning and try to always get all I can out of each day and all experiences! I hope to keep learning more in the future!",
