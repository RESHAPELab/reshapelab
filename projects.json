            "project_description": "In this research project, we investigate whether and how open source software (OSS) have gender biases tied with minorities, and how to remove any such biases that are found. Minorities are vastly underrepresented among OSS developers. This is a significant concern to OSS communities because it prevents them from receiving the benefits of a larger talent pool and the benefits that ensue from team diversity. Further, the problem feeds upon itself: developers who are from minorities then miss out on the learning and professional growth opportunities that OSS projects provide, and professional opportunities evade minorities when open source contributions are used to make hiring decisions, both of which hold them back from OSS engagement.",

As part of this project we use different approaches to support students to learn software engineering concepts and open source process by means of innovative and inclusive approaches, changing the traditional learning experience. This include the use of worked examples, gamification, conversation agents, and large language models. We also explore the impact of using OSS in classroom. This project involves several empirical methods, including lab studies, field studies, observation, experiments, and analysis of documents. We believe that learning on top of OSS helps students to learn on real settings and to build a professional resum√© based on OSS contributions",
